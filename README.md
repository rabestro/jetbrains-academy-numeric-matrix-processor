# Project: Numeric Matrix Processor

## About

The solution for the project is in [src](Numeric%20Matrix%20Processor/task/src/processor/). The integration tests are proveded by Hyperskill. 

## Project description

Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

## Learning outcomes

Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using arrays in practice.

### What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- [Stage 1/6: Addition](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60/stages/323/implement)
  Use multi-dimensional arrays to add matrices.
- [Stage 2/6: Multiplication by number](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60/stages/324/implement) 
  Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result.
- [Stage 3/6: Matrix by matrix multiplication](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60/stages/325/implement) 
  Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your matrix processor.
- [Stage 4/6: Transpose](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60/stages/326/implement) 
  Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition, and then add this option to the menu.
- [Stage 5/6: Determined!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60/stages/327/implement) 
  Use recursion to enable your program to find the determinant.
- [Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60/stages/328/implement)
  Yet another possible operation is finding the inverse of a matrix: add this option to your program.
